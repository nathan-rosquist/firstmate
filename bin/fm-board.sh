# fm-board.sh - render the operator board as one self-contained HTML artifact.
#
# The board is the four-column operator surface: Waiting on you, Under way,
# Queued, and Landed.
# It exists because that surface was being hand-written per refresh, which made
# every board a fresh transcription of state that had already moved.
#
# This command does not parse fleet state itself.
# Like bin/fm-fleet-view.sh it shells out to bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh --json and
# renders that stable structured contract, so the snapshot stays the one owner of
# what the fleet currently is.
#
# THE SEAM. The script owns everything mechanically derivable from durable state
# and nothing else:
#   Under way   one card per live direct report, from its recorded metadata plus
#               the current state bin/fm-crew-state.sh reports, stamped with the
#               time that state was read.
#   Queued      queued backlog items with their unresolved blockers and date gates.
#   Landed      recent completions with their delivery artifact, including the
#               landings rolled up from delegated homes.
#   Waiting on you, the mechanical half: work with a locally recorded pull request,
#               captain-held queued items, and every unresolved decision key folded
#               out of the durable status logs, here and in every delegated home.
#               A delegated home the snapshot could not read whole is named rather
#               than reported as holding nothing.
#
# The script does NOT derive the judgment half.
# Option lists, recommendations, the reasoning for preferring one option, and the
# chores only the operator can do are written per decision and cannot be inferred
# from a status line, so they arrive through --cards as authored input that is
# merged into the Waiting-on-you column alongside the mechanical cards.
# See BOARD CARDS in --help for that format; it is validated, never trusted.
#
# A decision key present in the durable logs with no authored card still renders,
# marked as not yet elaborated. Silence about a pending decision is the one
# failure this board must not have, so an unelaborated key is never dropped.
#
# ANSWERS. A click is an answer to a durable decision, not to a card, so it
# carries the card's validated `binds` and the time this board's state was read.
# An answer that arrives after its decision has closed is then recognisable as an
# answer to a board that has since moved, rather than acted on a second time.
# The answered card, not the send control, carries that the answer went: a
# control that only reports a message leaving the browser makes pressing it again
# the reasonable thing to do. A regenerated board drops resolved decisions
# outright; the answered mark covers only the window until then.
# See ANSWERS in --help for the exact payload.
#
# The artifact is self-contained: one file, no CDN, no sibling assets, so it opens
# from disk on any device whether or not a viewer is running. Every rendered string
# is HTML-escaped, and paths under the operator's home are reduced to ~ before
# rendering; the write is refused outright if the home path survives into the output.
#
# Read-only with respect to the fleet: no lock, no wake queue, no mutation, and no
# network. It writes only its own artifact and prints that path.
# It never polls: arming the artifact as a wake source is a separate step, owned by
# bin/fm-procevent.sh and its Lavish adapter.

Render the operator board from live fleet state and print the artifact path.

Options:
  --cards <file>     authored Waiting-on-you cards (see BOARD CARDS below)
  --out <path>       artifact path (default: $FM_HOME/.lavish/board.html)
  --snapshot <file>  render a saved `fm-fleet-snapshot.sh --json` instead of
                     taking a fresh snapshot; "-" reads stdin
  --landed <n>       how many recent landings to show (default: 8)
  --title <text>     page title (default: The Bridge)
  --stale-mins <n>   minutes of age after which the board warns it is stale;
                     twice that marks it too old to trust (default: 30)

BOARD CARDS

  A line-oriented text file. Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
  Each card opens with a type header and is followed by `field: value` lines.
  Repeatable fields keep the order they are written in. Values are single-line.

    [decision]
    key: mesh-note                 required, identifies the answer; slug only
    binds: listen-collapse-a30:default
                                   optional; the durable decision this elaborates,
                                   written as <task-id>:<decision-key>
    title: One word, whenever      required
    tag: listening screen          optional badge
    body: A paragraph.             repeatable
    warn: Three rounds on one theme.
                                   repeatable; renders as a callout
    option: ship | **Ship it** - one paragraph recording a measured fact
                                   repeatable, at least one; `<value> | <label>`,
                                   where the value is a slug and the label is
                                   everything after the first ' | '
    recommend: ship                optional; must name one of this card's options
    footnote: Why not the other one today ...
                                   repeatable; small print under the options

    [chores]
    title: Only you can do these   optional
    item: **Tier-2 listening session.** 22 clips staged.
                                   repeatable, at least one
    footnote: No pull request waiting on a merge.
                                   optional

  Labels, bodies, items, warnings and footnotes take a small inline markup:
  **bold**, *italic*, and `code`. Everything else is escaped, so authored text
  can never inject markup of its own. Backticks must be balanced.

  The file is validated as a whole before anything is written: an unknown field,
  a card missing a required field, a duplicate of a once-only field such as key,
  title, tag, recommend or binds, an option value that is not a
  slug, a recommendation that names no option, or a `binds` naming a decision the
  durable logs do not have all refuse the render rather than producing a partial
  board. A decision open in a delegated home is bound as <home>/<task-id>:<key>.

ANSWERS

  Picking an option and pressing Send hands the attached review session one
  prompt plus this payload:

    { tag: "board-answers",
      generated: "<the board's snapshot time, ISO 8601>",
      text: "<one readable line per answer>",
      data: {
        generated: "<the same snapshot time>",
        answers: {
          "<card key>": {
            question: "<the card's title>",
            binds: "<task-id>:<decision-key>", or null on an unbound card,
            snapshot: "<the same snapshot time>",
            answer: "<the option value that was picked>"
          }
        }
      } }

  Check `binds` against the decisions still open before acting: an answer whose
  decision has already closed answers a board that has since moved, and is
  reported as such rather than carried out again.

  With no review session attached nothing is sent; the answers are copied to the
  clipboard instead, under the same generated-time header the prompt carries,
  and the page says so.

# Waiting on you, mechanical half.

# A decision held in a delegated home is a pending decision like any other, and
# the board already reaches into delegated state for its landings, so the two
# sources are folded into one list off one identity. A delegated entry carries
# the home it came from; a main-home entry carries no home.
# A delegated entry's `summary` carries two different things depending on how the
# snapshot built it, so which slot it belongs in is read off the entry's own kind
# rather than guessed from the text. A captain hold carries the item title in
# `summary` and the hold reason in `reason`; a status decision carries the
# decision text in `summary` and no reason. Either way the heading names the work
# and the body carries what is actually being decided, so no card says the same
# thing twice and nothing the snapshot carried is dropped.
