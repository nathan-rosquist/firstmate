# Shared session-lock harness identity.
#
# ONE owner of the "which verified-harness process holds this home's session
# lock, and does the current process descend from that same harness?" decision.
# bin/fm-lock.sh uses it to acquire and inspect state/.lock;
# bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh uses it to prove a Stop hook fires inside the
# lock-owning primary session before it may arm or rewake.
# This file is sourced by scripts and has no side effects on source.

# Cursor process identity is NOT expressible as a command-name pattern and is
# deliberately not added to the tables below: Cursor's installed names are
# cursor-agent and the far-too-generic legacy alias `agent`, and it runs as a
# bundled node script. bin/fm-cursor-lib.sh is the fleet's single owner of that
# decision, so this file delegates to it rather than widening the name match.
# shellcheck source=bin/fm-cursor-lib.sh

# Native Windows process facts, for the MSYS case where this process tree cannot
# reach its own harness. Sourced unconditionally; every entry point in it gates
# on fm_winproc_available, so a Linux or macOS home is unaffected.

# Print a Windows image path in the form the harness matcher expects.
#
# fm_harness_process_matches and fm_harness_path_name below both reason about
# path COMPONENTS, and a Windows image path separates them with backslashes.
# Converting to forward slashes first is what makes those two functions see the
# same structure on Windows that they see on Linux, so the harness decision
# stays in one owner rather than growing a second, platform-specific rule.
#
# Without the conversion the verdict would rest on basename's platform
# behaviour, which differs: MSYS basename splits on backslashes while GNU
# basename does not, so the same string identifies a different thing depending
# on which coreutils answered.
#
# Note this deliberately does NOT narrow fm_harness_path_name's documented
# component match. A path with a "claude" directory in it resolves as a harness
# here exactly as "/home/claude/proj/node" already does on Linux; that widening
# is upstream's trade-off for a version-named Claude Code binary, and narrowing
# it on one platform only would be the real defect.

#   2. A walk up the real Windows parent chain. This is the structural source
#      and the only one that works for a harness exporting no pid at all, but
#      it costs one PowerShell CIM snapshot (~1.5s) and it breaks if an
#      intermediate shell has already exited, since Windows does not reparent.
#
