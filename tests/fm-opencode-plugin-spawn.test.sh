# shell script through bash, never through its shebang.
#
# Windows has no shebang. CreateProcess cannot execute a .sh at all, so
# spawn("/path/to/x.sh") fails with EFTYPE, and every one of these plugins
# converts a spawn error into {code: 0} - which reads as "allowed", "no nudge",
# or "guard passed". The whole OpenCode surface therefore fails open and silent
# on Windows, which is why the structural check below is the primary guard: it
# fails on every platform, including the Linux CI where the broken form happens
# to work.
