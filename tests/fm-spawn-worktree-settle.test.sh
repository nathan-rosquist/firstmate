# Regression test for how bin/fm-spawn.sh acquires a crewmate or scout worktree.
#
# The worktree is leased in fm-spawn.sh's own shell with `treehouse get --lease`
# and the pane is then sent a plain `cd` into that already-known path. That
# replaced a loop that discovered the worktree by polling the pane's cwd, which
# could never succeed on a backend that cannot report a live path (Herdr on
# Windows reports null forever) and could accept a transient stale read on the
# backends that can.
#
# These cases pin the properties that acquisition now depends on: the leased
# path is what gets recorded, an unusable lease refuses instead of launching, a
# pane that never arrives refuses, a pane that cannot answer at all still
# launches, and every failure between the lease and the published task record
# hands the lease back so a pool slot is not burned.
